# note - the is folder is a deprecated version

This folder includes a list of projects and backtests that I have completed or worked on in the past.

I used this folder at a time when I didn’t know much about Git and GitHub, so the codebase was unordered and messy while I was working on these projects.

The work I have done here is not very significant in terms of value, but it allowed me to learn. The only notable contribution I made during that time was hosting historical data for about 1,800 stocks (from the Indian markets), which I had fetched for my personal use. I maintained this data on JioCloud after a Reddit user requested it on a stock-related subreddit.

Unfortunately, I included a link to this particular folder in multiple resumes that I used to apply for different roles. Some of those applications are still in process as I am making this commit. Therefore, I will maintain this folder for a while (maybe for about 1-2 months)... to be precise, until I receive rejections from those applications. I have recieved those rejection mails, will be deleting these files within 2 days.

If you are a recruiter, I would kindly request you to visit the work at this [link](https://github.com/bh1rg1v/algorithmic-trading/tree/main/backtesting).

I have made a copy of this exact folder to refactor the codebase with proper documentation, design, and architecture.
