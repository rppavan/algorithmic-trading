This folder includes a list of projects and backtests that I have completed or worked on in the past.

I used this folder at a time when I didn’t know much about Git and GitHub, so the codebase was unordered and messy while I was working on these projects.

The work I have done here is not very significant in terms of value, but it allowed me to learn. The only notable contribution I made during that time was hosting historical data for about 1,800 stocks (from the Indian markets), which I had fetched for my personal use. I maintained this data on JioCloud after a Reddit user requested it on a stock-related subreddit.

Hosting that data on public cloud services has earned the repository about 18 stars so far (as of 04:48 AM on Feb 09, 2026). What I’m trying to say is that the work I’ve done has contributed value to some people. And that’s the point of the work we do, right—to make a meaningful contribution to the community.

Unfortunately, I included a link to this particular folder in multiple resumes that I used to apply for different roles. Some of those applications are still in process as I am making this commit. Therefore, I will maintain this folder for a while (maybe for about 1–2 months)—to be precise, until I receive rejections from those applications.

If you are a recruiter, I would kindly request you to visit the work at this link.

I have made a copy of this exact folder to refactor the codebase with proper documentation, design, and architecture.
